# Invoices endpoint

The `invoices` endpoint provides one or more machine readable invoices, including line item and payment information. These invoices can be imported directly into an ERP or accounting system to support seamless financial processes.

## Ordering

Invoices are returned in `invoiceDate` ascending order.

## Considerations
 
> **ğŸ›ˆ Invoices are available on this endpoint once finalised by Globetrotter.**

> **ğŸ›ˆ Payments and changes can take time to register in the system.**
