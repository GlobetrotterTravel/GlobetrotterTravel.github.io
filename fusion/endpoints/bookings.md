# Bookings endpoint

The `bookings` endpoint contains the trip file data for a single passenger name record (PNR). Each booking/PNR is uniquely identified by the `recordLocator` which is a 6 character alphanumeric string.

## Return order

Bookings are returned in `bookingDate` ascending order.

## Considerations

> **ðŸ›ˆ Globetrotter's policy is to place each traveller on a separate PNR, even when more than one person is travelling together.**

> **ðŸ›ˆ Custom data is at the PNR/trip level, not at segment level.**

> **âš  Travel that has not been booked by Globetrotter or in a Globetrotter system (e.g. Serko or Concur) will not be returned.**

> **âš  This endpoint does not track travellers in realtime.**

> **âš  This endpoint should not be relied upon as the sole data provider for on-trip traveller safety. Globetrotter recommends clients use ISOS.**
