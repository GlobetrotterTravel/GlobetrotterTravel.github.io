# Organizations
{: .no_toc }

The primary resource managed in Iris is the organization. Each instance of a resource is owned directly or indirectly by an organization.

Organizations are not split between types. Instead, a dimension or tag can be used to categorise organizations into sets for management.

Organizations can have parent/child relationships to any depth. Circular relationships are not permitted.
