## Entitlements
{: .no_toc }

An entitlement is something of value provided to an organization. Entitlement instances are derived from entitlement definitions, which contain a name and a description.

When an entitlement instance is created for an organization, a start and an end date is specified. This way, tenants can manage the validity of client entitlements by managing expiry periods and rebilling.

Only one entitlement instance can be assigned to each organisation per entitlement definition.
