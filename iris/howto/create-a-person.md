## Create a person from the People list

In the left hand menu, click `People`.

In the toolbar, click the `New` button.

A blank person detail page loads.

In the `Organization` select box, choose the organization that this person will belong to. If an organization inherits its people list from a parent, then that organization will not be available for selection. Add the person to a non-inheriting organization instead.

Set the user's `First Name`, `Last Name` and `Email Address`. The email address must be unique within an organization and its children.

Move across the tabs to set the person's facets.

In the toolbar, click the `Save` button. A confirmation appears.

You will be navigated back to the `People` list.

In the left hand menu, click `Organizations`.

Locate the organization to which the person should be added. In the `Actions` column, click `Edit`. The `Organization Detail` page appears.

Click the `People` tab.

Click the `New` button in the `People` toolbar.

The `Person Detail` page appears. If the incorrect organization is selected, it can be changed via the select box.
