## calculation 
The process or formula that transforms one or more `measures` into a metric. `Calculations` may involve arithmetic operations, statistical methods, or more complex algorithms. They provide the operational logic behind metrics.  

## dimension 
A descriptive attribute or set of attributes used to categorize, segment, and provide context for your `measures` and `metrics`. `Dimensions` are the structural elements of your data model that group raw data into meaningful bins to enable detailed analysis and reporting.

## focus area
A broad segment of your travel program that groups related `metrics`, `measures`, and `calculations` into a cohesive view. Each travel program `focus area` represents a distinct strategic component that merits its own analysis and reporting focus. These `focus areas` organize your analytics into clear, dedicated sections, similar to individual slides in a presentation, making it easier for business leaders to pinpoint areas for improvement and strategy.

## insight 
An actionable conclusion drawn from a collection of related `metrics`. `Insights` combine several quantitative measurements to reveal trends, opportunities, or challenges that inform strategic decision-making.

## lost opportunity

When a cheaper fare was available within the set policy for the client.

## low fare ticket

The best fare of the day defined by the client's travel policy.

## metric 
A specific, quantitative measurement that reflects a particular aspect of performance. `Metrics` are derived either directly from raw data or via `calculations` and are used to evaluate the state or progress of a process.  

## measure 
A fundamental numeric data point captured from the operation of your travel program. Measures are aggregated or transformed through calculations to generate `metrics`. While “measure” and “metric” are sometimes used interchangeably, here `measures` refer to the raw data values, and metrics are the contextualized or aggregated outcomes that drive business insights.

## original ticket

A flight that is booked and ticketed without involving an `exchange` or `refund`.

## visual 
Any graphical representation - such as charts, graphs, dashboards, or maps - that communicates data findings (`measures`, `metrics`, `calculations`, and `insights`) in an accessible format. `Visuals` are critical for quickly conveying trends and patterns, enabling informed decision-making.
